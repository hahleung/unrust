## Rules

How to kill:
- each killer has a mission to kill another killer
- if the kill is successful, the killer gets the mission of the killed person
- the winner is the last killer.

How to counter-kill:
- say "counter-kill" to the killer who's trying to killing you
- you're dead if you're wrong, think twice before saying "counter-kill"!
- a killer who's been counter-killed is out.

You've been killed or you've killed someone?
- come to see me.

How many time?
- start at 7 pm, finish at 11pm, all in background.

## Example

Missions:
- killer A has to perform on Killer B: "say 'God saves the Queen'"
- killer B has to perform on Killer C: "kiss on the cheek"

Possible scenarios:
- if Killer A makes Killer B say 'God saves the Queen', Killer A has to kill Killer C now
- if Killer B counter-killed Killer A, Killer A is out.
